I’ve been a grassroots lawyer, a Human Rights activist, an access to justice specialist for the U.N., a judicial and legal reform consultant for the World Bank, a justice sector project manager for other international agencies, a social entrepreneur, an innovation management consultant and trainer, a college lecturer and an improv actor. 

Currently, I’m the Executive Director of a small nonprofit, I practice Aikido frequently, and, above all, I am dedicating to being the best father and a husband I can be.

On the side, I am trying to learn design, drawing, programming, business and writing.

I am originally for Venezuela, but I now live in a beautiful and peaceful rural area on the East Coast of the United States.

Please contact me if I can be of any assistance to you. My email is in the footer of this website.
