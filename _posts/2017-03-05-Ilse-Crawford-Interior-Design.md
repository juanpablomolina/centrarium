# Interior Design notes

These are my notes from [Abstract The Art of Design, Episode 6: Ilse Crawford: Interior Design][https://www.netflix.com/title/80057883].

## Keywords and Concepts   

* A client's idea can intentionally be **translated** into space, furniture, food, uniforms, etc. that is prepared to **reflect** that idea.
* **Empathy** with the client for whom you are designing something.  At first: hold off your opinion. Watch and listen. "Two eyes, two ears and one mouth. Use them in that proportion".
* **Interrogate.**  
* Materials. More compelling when they are seen in context, in light, in association with the other materials it will with.  We understand materials best by contrast.
* **Human engineering -  wellbeing.** Space and furniture design can encourage and influence people to behave and feel in a particular way.  Airport lounge: How to create an environment where people feel better after they leave than when they arrived.  They don't know why they feel better, but it has been all orchestrated. 
* Good design comes from relationship with the maker.  It takes may **iterations** to be refined enough for it to live on its own.
