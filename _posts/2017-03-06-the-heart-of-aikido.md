# The Heart Of Aikido 

## by Morihei Ueshiba

[Morihei Ueshiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morihei_Ueshiba) was the founder of the martial art [Aikido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido).  Here are some basic concepts from his book: "The Heart of Aikido"

**Enter.** When confronted by an opponent, enter his mind, the space and body to neutralize his attack.

**Speed.** Entering the opponent quickly, like thunder or lightning. 

**Guide.** After entering, move your opponent's mind and body. Guide him.

**Distance.** The distance between you and your opponent is both physical and spiritual. Stay *centered* while you measure this distance.
