Today I went out surfing. It was the fifth or six time I try surfing.

I learnt that:

1.  It requires mental focus as much as physical flexibility, reflexes, balance and endurance. 
2. Getting from the beach through the breaking waves to the area passed the breaking waves where I wait to catch my wave, is exhausting.    
3. When I (try to) pop-up, my right knee drags against the board.  My next step is to learn to pop-up without any other points of contact with the board than my hands and my back foot. 
4. Waxing the board helps a lot. But since I am dragging my knees, it also scrapes them. 
5. Paddling to catch a wave is also exhausting.
6. When I am paddling to catch a wave but fail to gain match the wave's speed, the wave catches up with me and elevates the back of my board and I nose dive.
