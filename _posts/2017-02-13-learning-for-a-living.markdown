# Learning for a Living

One of the activities I enjoy the most is *learning*. 

In fact, this blog entry is my first step in a personal experiment to see if I can make a living out of learning.  The project consists in documenting what I learn as I engage in the activities I am interested in, and then share what I've documented in a way that other people - hopefully - find useful. 

To achieve this goal, I will be developing a system, a personal workflow, a platform from where to share, and I will also need the discipline to keep it all going. I will have to take notes as I engage in the activities I am learning, organize my thinking about what I have learned, think how it can be useful to others, write it, and then publish it in an accessible platform. 

## Current Learning

I am currently engaged and learning about the following two activities that I want to start this experiment with: 

### Nonprofit management
I run a small nonprofit in a rural area on the East Coast of the United States.  I am the Executive Director of this nonprofit. Every day, I work hard to improve our operations, raise more money and increase our impact in the community we serve.  There are many Executive Directors just like me out there, and I know that most of us are facing difficult challenges every day and figuring out how to deal with them on the go. 

To access what I have to share regarding nonprofit management, go to - and please subscribe - the [Nonprofit MBA][npmba].

### Aikido
I have been practicing [Aikido][Aik] regularly for the past two years.  I had practiced way long ago in the past, on and off. I enjoy it very much and I feel very strongly about the principles of peaceful conflict resolution Aikido is built upon. Each time a practice Aikido, I walk off the practice matt a better person. I just can't get enough of it. 

If you are interested in reading about my Aikido learning, you can subscribe to this blog to get an update of when I get the Aikido webpage up and running.

## My learning wish list

I also have much interest in the following three activities, but since I don't engage in them frequently it will take me a while to share about them. If you are interested, subscribe to this blog to get updates on when I start sharing about these.

### Design
I discovered [design thinking][dt] rather recently, and I have been blown away by its emphasis on *process*, as well as with its creative tools like *prototyping* and *iterations*.  It's just not the way I have been trained to think in the past.  I feel that learning to think like a designer will enrich my current approach to my work by allowing me to exercise more creativity in my daily activities. 

### Improv
I was an improv actor for about two years. [Improvisational acting][imp] is an extremely challenging and wonderful activity.  It is deeply rooted in *feelings*, *expression*, and *authenticity*.  The theory and practice of improv is incredibly rich and I can't wait for another opportunity to dive in.

### Programming
I've enjoyed programming since I was a kid, I even started pursuing a career in programming, but I had a change in heart back then.  Today, there are personal (e.g. this experiment's web pages) and work (a database app for my nonprofit) reasons why I keep having to do some 'light' programming.  It is a powerful tool that I want to continue to play with. 

## Setup

Below is a list of the equipment that I used to write this post today. It all worked pretty well and fits in a small laptop bag: 
1. Logitech K480 Bluetooth Keyboard. 
2. Nexus 10 Tablet, held up by the Logitech Keyboard.    
3. Panasonic ErgoFit In-Ear Earbud Headphones. 
4. Pixel Phone by Google, running Google Play Music to listen to classical music.
5. 10 ft long mini usb charging cable for the Nexus.


I am running the following Apps on my Nexus:
1. iA writer, to write the post - I really like the interface.
2. Dropbox, connected to iA writer to store each post.
3. Mr Hyde, to commit and push the new post to Github. 

To publish the blog I use [Jekyll running on Github][Jek].
